Usage: when inputting a line you must consider that
  a-The first value is the coefficient of y
  m-The second value is the coefficient of x
  b-The third value is the constant term

The form that is assumed is: ay=mx+b

If you want to do a vertical line at x = 10,
  a=0
  m=1
  b=-10
  0y=1x-10

  So you would input "0 1 -10"
